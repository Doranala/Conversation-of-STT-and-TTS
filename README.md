Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. It leverages automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis technologies to create seamless interaction between spoken and written language.

Features
Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts spoken audio into text with high accuracy.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generates natural-sounding speech from text input.

Language Support: Supports multiple languages for both STT and TTS.

Customizable: Allows voice and pronunciation customization for TTS.

Real-Time Processing: Provides low-latency conversions suitable for real-time applications.

Applications
Accessibility Tools: Assists users with disabilities, such as screen readers and voice typing.

Virtual Assistants: Powers voice-driven interactions in AI assistants.

Language Translation: Enables speech-to-speech translation across languages.

Customer Support: Enhances automated customer service systems.

Technologies Used
Speech Recognition Engine: (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, or CMU Sphinx)

Text-to-Speech Engine: (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech, AWS Polly, or Festival)

Programming Language: Python or JavaScript (depending on implementation)

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other relevant libraries.
