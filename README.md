# Conversation-of-STT-and-TTS
A Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech project focuses on converting spoken words into text and vice versa. It uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) for transcription and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis to produce natural-sounding audio. Applications include accessibility tools, virtual assistants, and real-time language translation.
